#### DESCRIPTION

This is a web page form that lets a user enter a city/state, and then displays current weather information for that city. Where available, the appropriate visual icons from the Open Weather site will be used. The following data will be displayed:

- a) temperature: current, min, max
- b) humidty
- c) description and icon
- d) visibility
- e) wind speed and compass direction
- f) Sunrise and Sunset
- g) 5 day forecast  (**** maybe/maybe NOT! this is not set in stone)


#### STATUS

~60% Complete. Initial GUI has been created with dummy data in place. Now it is time to move on to the actual coding to make the form work.
