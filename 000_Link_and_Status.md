#### DESCRIPTION

This is a web page form that lets a user enter a city/state, and then displays current weather information for that city. Where available, the appropriate visual icons from the Open Weather site will be used. The following data will be displayed:

- a) temperature: current, min, max
- b) humidty
- c) description and icon
- d) visibility
- e) wind speed and compass direction
- f) Sunrise and Sunset
- g) 4 day forecast  (**** maybe/maybe NOT! this is not set in stone)


#### STATUS

~70% Complete. Base query is working and returning data from OpenWeatherMap.org. Only a few fields are displaying retrieved data. Next step is to implement error handling to ensure a city was retrieved, and then to write functions to populate all of the "fields" (html elements) on the page, or to clear all of the "fields" in the case that no city data was returned from the query.
